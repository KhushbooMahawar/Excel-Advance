As the lead analyst for WeFit, I conducted an analysis of Fitbit fitness tracker data to address various business challenges. Firstly, using the data, I identified potential customers for LeanFit's personalized weight loss diet plans based on BMI, heart rate, and blood pressure. Secondly, I identified potential customers for FitWear's fitness gear based on their fitness levels and online shopping preferences. Thirdly, I targeted individuals with sleep schedule disruptions for Sleepy-Nights' sleep scheduling app subscriptions. Lastly, I created a dashboard presenting daily activity data, including user engagement, distance traveled, steps, calories burned, and active minutes, categorized by user types.
